# MontyHallSimulation
## Idea
The main idea behind this small project is to create a python script which should simulate the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).
## Configuration
You can change the following parameter very easily: < /br>
-the door you want to pick
-the number of rounds the script should simulate
-if you want to stay at the picked door or change it after Monty showed you one door
